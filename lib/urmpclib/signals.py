"""Provides a few utility function using urwid's signals.

urwid requires emitters to register by class and listeners to specify the
emitter and all kinds of overengineered bullshit. Sometimes we just want to
send a signal from whereever and and have anybody listening receive it. When
that is what you need, use this."""
